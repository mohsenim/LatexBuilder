# Latex Builder

This is a simplified version of [latex-action](https://github.com/xu-cheng/latex-action). You only need to upload your files to the `files` directory and rename the main TeX file to `main.tex`. Additionally, you should enable write permissions for GitHub Actions workflows in the repository settings.

After each push, the compiled PDF file will be accessible in the release section of the repository under the name `main.pdf`.

If you have more specific requirements, please refer to the original repository.
